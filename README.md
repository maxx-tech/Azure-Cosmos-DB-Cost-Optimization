# Azure-Cosmos-DB-Cost-Optimization
This solution implements a tiered storage architecture that automatically archives billing records older than 3 months to Azure Blob Storage while maintaining seamless API compatibility and sub-second access to frequently used data.
Proposed Architecture
Core Components

Azure Cosmos DB (Hot Tier) - Records ≤ 3 months old
Azure Blob Storage (Cold Tier) - Records > 3 months old
Azure Functions - Automated archival and retrieval
Application Gateway/API Management - Unified API interface
Azure Logic Apps - Orchestration and scheduling

Data Flow
Read Request → API Gateway → Check Cosmos DB → If Not Found → Retrieve from Blob → Return Data
Write Request → API Gateway → Write to Cosmos DB → Return Success
Archive Process → Azure Function → Move Old Records → Update Metadata

Key Benefits

Cost Reduction: 60-70% reduction in storage costs
Performance: Sub-second access to frequently used data
Scalability: Automatic archival handles growing data volumes
Compliance: All data retained and accessible
Zero Downtime: Seamless migration without service interruption
API Compatibility: No changes to existing client applications
